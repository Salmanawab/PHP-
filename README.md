Task 1:
Variables and Basic Data Manipulation:I created a PHP script that declared and displayed various personal information, including name, gender, age, address, degree, date of birth, and contact details.
I demonstrated the concept of variable juggling by swapping the values of two variables using a temporary variable and displayed the values both before and after the swap.
I worked with different data types, such as integers, strings, floats, booleans, arrays, and null values. I used functions like gettype() and var_dump() to display the type and value of each variable.

Task 2:
Operators:I wrote a PHP script to perform various arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo) on two numerical variables.
I utilized comparison operators to compare two variables and determine if one is greater than, less than, or equal to the other.
I demonstrated the use of assignment operators, such as +=, -=, *=, /=, and %= to modify the value of a variable.
I also worked with logical operators (AND, OR, and NOT), where I defined boolean variables and evaluated logical conditions.
These tasks helped me to better understand key concepts in PHP, such as variable handling, operators, and data manipulation. I have gained practical experience in PHP programming, which I am excited to apply in future projects.
